# CustomClaimProvider

This repository contains two JavaScript files: CustomClaimProviderDemo.js and CustomClaimProviderLDAP.js used in pipedream in the demo blog[https://suryendub.github.io/2024-01-05-Custom-Claims-Provider/].
`CustomClaimProviderDemo.js` is a file that demonstrates the usage and implementation of a custom claims provider. It showcases how to integrate custom claims into an application or system, providing additional authorization and authentication capabilities.

`CustomClaimProviderLDAP.js` is a file that specifically focuses on the integration of a custom claims provider with an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) server. It provides functionality and code examples for retrieving and processing user attributes from an LDAP server to generate custom claims.

These files can serve as valuable resources for developers looking to implement custom claims providers and integrate them with LDAP servers in their applications or systems. They provide practical examples and code snippets to guide developers through the process of implementing custom claims functionality.
